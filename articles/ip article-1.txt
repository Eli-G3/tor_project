Internet Protocol(IP)

Introduction
An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. This is the most commonly used protocol to communicate over networks and transfer data. An IP address serves two main functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing.

The Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model) is a conceptual model that characterizes and standardizes the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technologyInternet Protocol (IP) sits directly on top of layer 2, as one of the protocols in the network layer and is responsible for getting datagrams to their destination.The IP layer does not provide any type of flow-control or sequencing capabilities—that's left to the upper layers. We'll be using "datagram" to refer to an entire IP message, and "packet" to identify an individual IP packet.

Types of IP addresses
So far,there are two types of IP addresses.
1. Internet protocol version 4(IPV4)
2. Internet protocol version 6(IPV6).


IPV4
	IPV4 is described in IETF publication RFC 791 (September 1981), replacing an earlier definition (RFC 760, January 1980).
IPV4 is an unique 32 bit binary number assigned to device connected to internet,which may change over time. All the communication in the network belonging to that device happens with that particular IPV4 address only. This 32 bit number can be divided into four equal halves with 8 bits each to represent it as four decimal numbers seperated by dots, which is also called as dotted decimal representation.
eg:192.0.0.1.
	This IPV4 address was divided into two parts, namely Network id and Host id.
The Network id was used to identify the netwoek to which the device was connected anf the Host id was used to identify the paerticular host. 
Based on this the IPV4 was again classified into different types.
	1. Class A
	2. Class B
	3. Class C
	4. Class D
	5. Class E
1.Class A
	This is the largest possible network(more number of hosts). In the 32 bit number the first bit is taken as 0 and the next seven bits are for network id. So the next 24 bits are for host id.
So by making the first bit as 0 and varying next seven bits to get possible network id's, We get that first octet vary from 0 to 127.
But we do not consider 0 and 127 because 0.0.0.0 can be used to mean anything from accept all IP addresses or block all IP addresses to the default route or to send the request back.
We do not consider 127 beacause we use 127.0.0.0 as loopback address or as a localhost.
so possible network id's are 1.0.0.0 to 126.0.0.0.
	Remaining 24 bits are used to configure hosts. So each network has 2^24 ip addresses out of which we can't use two to configure hosts.
This is beacause the first host id, which is x.0.0.0 is used as network id and the last one x.255.255.255 is used as Directed Broadcat adress.
2.Class B
	On choosing the bit of 32 bit number as 0, we get ip addresses of class A. This splits the all possible combinations(2^32) of ip's into two. One set starts with 0 and the other with 1.
On choosing the second bit of set of ip's starting with 1 to 0.We again end up splitting them into two sets again starting with 10 and 11.
The ip's starting with 10 are of class B with first 16 bits as network id.   
so possible network id's are 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.0.0(first octet varies from 128 to 191 and the second from 0 to 255).
3.Class C
      On choosing the first two bits of 32 bit number as 10, we get ip addresses of class B. This splits the all possible combinations(2^31) of ip's into two. One set starts with 10 and the other with 11.
On choosing the third bit of set of ip's starting with 11 to 110.We again end up splitting them into two sets again starting with 110 and 111.
The ip's starting with 110 are of class C with first 24 bits as network id.   
so possible network id's are 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.0(first octet varies from 1292 to 1223 and the second from 0 to 255 and the third from 0 to 255).
4.Class D
On choosing the first three bits of 32 bit number as 110, we get ip addresses of class C. This splits the all possible combinations(2^30) of ip's into two. One set starts with 110 and the other with 111.
On choosing the fourth bit of set of ip's starting with 110 to 1110.We again end up splitting them into two sets again starting with 1110 and 1111.
The ip's starting with 1110 are of class D.
The purpose of Class D is said to be Multicasting.
5.Class E
The ip addresses satring with 1111 belongs to class E.These are reserved ip addresses and the use of them is not known.

Problem with above classification.
	If we take a network of Class C, We can configure 254 hosts, which is the least possible hosts that can be configured.
what if a person configures not more than 50 hosts and at time. the remaining 204 hosts that can be configured aren't. So to avoid this, A new method is used to classify them.
	The first x bits of 32 bit number are choosed as the network id and the remaining 32-x bits are used as the host id.
The above ip address is represented as a.b.c.d/x. a,b,c,d are the decimal numbers or octets.
This decreases the above problem to an extent.

This protocol uses the below link and physical layer to send and receive data in the form of packets.
A packet has much information like Total kength of the data,source data, Destination address,data,Time to live, Header Checksum, Fragment offset and many more.
The components of a IPV4 packet
1.Version
	Since this is a IPV4 packet, 4 is stored in the version 
2.Internet Header Length (IHL)
The second field (4 bits) is the Internet Header Length (IHL), which is the number of 32-bit words in the header. Since an IPv4 header may contain a variable number of options, this field specifies the size of the header (this also coincides with the offset to the data). The minimum value for this field is 5 (RFC 791), which is a length of 5×32 = 160 bits = 20 bytes. Being a 4-bit value, the maximum length is 15 words (15×32 bits) or 480 bits = 60 bytes.
3.Total Length
	Length of entire IP Packet (including IP header and IP Payload). 
4.Identification
	If IP packet is fragmented during the transmission, all the fragments contain same identification number. to identify original IP packet they belong to.
5.Don't Fragment
	This is a single bit number with 0 or 1. which tells the router or the switch to not to split the packet when it's 1. This is used to know the Maximum size of a packet that can be send along the path(MTU Discovery).
6.More Fragments
	This is a single bit number with 0 or 1. If the value is 1, then it implies there are even more packets that are to be assembled to get the final message.
7.Source Address
	This is the ip address of the source i.e, The ip address where we got the packet from.
8.Destination Adress
	This is the ip address of the server or host where the message is to be delivered.
9.Data
	The Data in this field is the message.
